## GMy Portfolio is a combination of Next.js, Three.js, WebGL, and R3F

There are 4 three.js scenes rendered in their own canvases, these are used as textures in a shader. Input from the scroll wheel scrolls through the scenes. Each scene is interactive.

The portfolio, news, and tutorials are connected to a headless CMS which renders dynamic content and paths and builds all of the contnet automatically.
