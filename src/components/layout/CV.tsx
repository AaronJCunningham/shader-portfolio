      <p>
        I am deeply inspired by the intersection of art and emerging
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main area of expertise as a frontend developer involves creating
        interactive, immersive websites, focusing on metaverses and 3D
        animations. My interest in web3 has been a significant part of my
        10-year career in the blockchain industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary tech stack includes TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Three.js,
        but I am flexible and excited to learn other technologies.
