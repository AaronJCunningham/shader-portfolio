      <p>
        As a <strong>three.js developer</strong>, I love pushing the boundaries
        of browser-based experiences, crafting immersive websites and
        metaverses.
      </p>

      <p>
        I build fullstack web applications, primarily using TypeScript, Next.js,
        React, and Supabase. However, I am always eager to learn and adapt to
        new technologies to expand my capabilities and stay at the forefront of
        web development.
