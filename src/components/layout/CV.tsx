        I'm a Lead Creative Technologist & Full-Stack Developer. I build
        immersive 3D experiences, full-stack Web3 platforms, and interactive
        data visualizations — from GLSL shaders to smart contracts to backend
        services. Everything I build works and looks right, backed by 7+ years
        of development and 10+ years of professional design.
      </p>

      <p>
        From 2024–2026, I was lead developer at BASEDAI, where I

          Montra

        I came into tech through design and blockchain — starting at{" "}

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"

        in 2014, then joining{" "}
        <a href="https://iost.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          IOST
        </a>{" "}
        where I was hired for my design and writing background and rose to Head
        of Growth, Europe. It was at IOST that I started building frontend code
        through an education fund, discovered I loved coding more than
        marketing, and made the switch. By 2020 I was lead developer at
        XELEVEN. I've spoken at{" "}

        .
      </p>

      <p>
        I use AI tooling — Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes — and agentic
        workflows to speed up development and ship faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond tech, my background in music includes five Billboard Top-20
        tracks, features in VICE and BoilerRoom, and nominations at the
        Oberhausen Film Festival and Prism Prize Awards.
      </p>

        I also use{" "}
